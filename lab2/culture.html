  <h1>Pune Culture</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Pune exemplifies an indigenous Marathi culture and ethos, in which education, arts and
    crafts, and theatres are given due prominence. It is the birthplace of the poet-saint Tukaram (in Dehu) and
    Jnaneshvara (in Alandi), the author of the well-known commentary ‘Jnaneshwari’,on the “Bhagavad Gita”. It is the
    home of great freedom fighters like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Agarkar and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Jayant Narlikar, the
    famous contemporary scientist, is from Pune. Pune is the seat of North Indian Classical music. Annually, in the
    month of December, it hosts a three nightlong cultural program of vocal and instrumental classical music, called
    “Savai-Gandharva”.Pune has been an example for the blending of the culture and heritage with modernisation and its
    side effects. Pune is the cultural capital of the Maharashtra..</p>
